# ARFIMA.jl
This Julia package simulates stochastic timeseries that follow the ARFIMA process, or any of its simplifications: ARIMA/ARMA/AR/MA/IMA.

The code base is also a proof-of-concept of using Julia's multiple dispatch.

This package is registered, to install do:
```
julia> ] add ARFIMA

julia> using ARFIMA
```
see the examples below for usage.

## ARFIMA and its variants
![the ARFIMA process](ARFIMA.png)

The ARFIMA process is composed out of several components and each can be included or not included in the process, resulting in simplified versions like ARMA.

## Usage
This package exports a single function `arfima`. This function  generates the timeseries `Xₜ` using Julia's multiple dispatch.

Here is its documentation string:

---

    arfima([rng,] N, σ, d, φ=nothing, θ=nothing) -> Xₜ
Create a stochastic timeseries of length `N` that follows the ARFIMA
process, or any of its subclasses, like e.g. ARMA, AR, ARIMA, etc., see below.
`σ` is the standard deviation of the white noise used to generate the
process. The first optional argument is an `AbstractRNG`, a random
number generator to establish reproducibility.

Julia's multiple dispatch system decides which will be the simulated variant
of the process, based on the types of `d, φ, θ`.

### Variants
The ARFIMA parameters are (p, d, q) with `p = length(φ)` and `q = length(θ)`,
with `p, q` describing the autoregressive or moving average "orders" while
`d` is the differencing "order".
Both `φ, θ` can be of two types: `Nothing` or `SVector`. If they are `Nothing`
the corresponding components of autoregressive (φ) and moving average (θ)
are not done. Otherwise, the static vectors simply contain their values.

If `d` is `Nothing`, then the differencing (integrated)
part is not done and the process is in fact AR/MA/ARMA.
If `d` is of type `Int`, then the simulated process is in fact ARIMA,
while if `d` is `AbstractFloat` then the process is AR**F**IMA.
In the last case it must hold that `d ∈ (-0.5, 0.5)`.
If all `d, φ, θ` are `nothing`, white noise is returned.

The function `arma(N, σ, φ, θ = nothing)` is provided for convienience.

### Examples
```julia
N, σ = 10_000, 0.5
X = arfima(N, σ, 0.4)                             # ARFIMA(0,d,0)
X = arfima(N, σ, 0.4, SVector(0.8, 1.2))          # ARFIMA(2,d,0)
X = arfima(N, σ, 1, SVector(0.8))                 # ARIMA(1,d,0)
X = arfima(N, σ, 1, SVector(0.8), SVector(1.2))   # ARIMA(1,d,1)
X = arfima(N, σ, 0.4, SVector(0.8), SVector(1.2)) # ARFIMA(1,d,1)
X = arfima(N, σ, nothing, SVector(0.8))           # ARFIMA(1,0,0) ≡ AR(1)
```

## Benchmarks
Some benchmark code is included in `src/benchmarks.jl`. These results come
from running the code on a laptop with Windows 10, Julia 1.2.0, Intel i5-6200U @2.30GHz CPU, 8192MB RAM. Results that need microseconds to run are not timed accurately.
